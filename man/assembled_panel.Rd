\title{Assemble Selected Items into MST panel}
\usage{
assembled_panel(x, result)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{"mstATA_design"} created by \code{mst_design()}.}

\item{result}{A solver result returned by \code{solve_model()}, containing
components \code{model} and \code{solution}.}
}
\value{
An object of S3 class \code{mstATA_panel} with a named list with one element per panel:
Panel_1, Panel_2, ....Each panel is a list with components:
\describe{
\item{ItemsInModules}{A data frame containing selected items grouped by
module. Columns include \code{item_name}, \code{item_id},
\code{varname}, \code{module_id}, and all item attributes from the item pool.}
\item{ItemsInPathways}{A data frame containing selected items grouped by
pathway. Columns include \code{item_name}, \code{item_id},
\code{varname}, \code{pathway_id}, and all item attributes from the item pool.}
}
}
\description{
Constructs a panel-centric representation of an assembled multistage panel
(MST) from the solver output. The function extracts binary decision
variables, maps them to items in the item pool, and organizes the
results by panel, module, and pathway.

This function is typically called after \code{solve_model()} and is intended
for post-solution interpretation, diagnostics, and reporting.
}
\details{
The workflow is:
\enumerate{
\item Extract item-module-panel binary decision variables with value 1 from the solver solution.
\item Parse decision variable names of the form
\code{x[module_id, item_id, panel_id]}.
\item Map internal item indices (\code{item_id}) to item-module-panel identifiers.
\item Merge selected items with the item pool to attach item attributes.
\item For each panel:
\itemize{
\item Construct \code{ItemsInModules}, listing items selected in each module.
\item Construct \code{ItemsInPathways}, listing items associated with each
pathway based on the pathway–module mapping.
}
}

If pathway or module labels are available in \code{x$PathwayIndex} and
\code{x$ModuleIndex}, labels for modules/pathways are attached.
