\title{Create Pathways Based an MST Design}
\usage{
create_pathways(design, diff_levels = NULL, exclude_pathways = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{A character string specifying the multistage test (MST) design.
The string defines the number of modules in each stage and may use commas
(\code{,}), dashes (\code{-}), or slashes (\code{/}) as separators. For
example, \code{"1-3-3"}, \code{"1,3,3"}, and \code{"1/3/3"} all define an MST
with 1 module in stage 1, 3 modules in stage 2, and 3 modules in stage 3.}

\item{diff_levels}{An optional named list specifying difficulty labels for
stages with a given number of modules. Names correspond to the number of
modules in a stage, and values are character vectors of difficulty labels.
If \code{NULL} (default), built-in labels are used for stages with up to five
modules. See \strong{Details}.}

\item{exclude_pathways}{An optional character vector identifying disallowed
pathways. Each element must be a string of the form \code{"x-y-z"}, where
each number denotes the module selected at a given stage. Module indices
must correspond to those implied by the MST design. If \code{NULL} (default),
all pathways implied by the design are allowed. This option is commonly used
to prohibit extreme routing transitions (e.g., from very easy to very hard
modules).}
}
\value{
A list with two data frames:

\describe{
\item{\code{Modules}}{A data frame containing module-level information with
columns \code{stage}, \code{module}, and \code{module_index}.}
\item{\code{Pathways}}{A data frame describing all constructed pathways.
Includes one column per stage (e.g., \code{stage1}, \code{stage2}, \dots),
a \code{pathway} identifier, and an \code{allowed} indicator. If difficulty
labels are available, an additional column \code{pathway_label} is
included.}
}
}
\description{
Generates all possible pathways implied by a multistage test (MST) design and
assigns module difficulty labels when available. If difficulty levels are not
supplied, default labels are applied for stages containing up to five modules.
}
\details{
\strong{1. Difficulty labels}

When \code{diff_levels = NULL}, default difficulty labels are assigned for
stages with up to five modules:

\itemize{
\item 1 module: \code{"M"}
\item 2 modules: \code{"E"}, \code{"H"}
\item 3 modules: \code{"E"}, \code{"M"}, \code{"H"}
\item 4 modules: \code{"XE"}, \code{"E"}, \code{"H"}, \code{"XH"}
\item 5 modules: \code{"XE"}, \code{"E"}, \code{"M"}, \code{"H"}, \code{"XH"}
}

If any stage contains more than five modules and \code{diff_levels} is not
provided, a message is issued and pathway difficulty labels are omitted from
the output. In such cases, users are encouraged to supply a custom
\code{diff_levels} list to ensure meaningful interpretation of module
difficulty.

\strong{2. Excluding pathways}

The \code{exclude_pathways} argument allows users to remove specific module
combinations from the set of possible pathways.

For example, under a \code{"1-3-3"} MST design:

\itemize{
\item All possible pathways (1 × 3 × 3 = 9) are:
\code{c("1-1-1", "1-1-2", "1-1-3", "1-2-1", "1-2-2", "1-2-3",
         "1-3-1", "1-3-2", "1-3-3")}

\item If extreme transitions are not permitted, one may specify:
\code{exclude_pathways = c("1-1-3", "1-3-1")}

\item This excludes transitions such as easy-to-hard (\code{"1-1-3"}) and
hard-to-easy (\code{"1-3-1"}).
}
}
