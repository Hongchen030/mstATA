\usage{
check_comblock_feasibility(model_spec, con_blocks, solver, time_limit = 99999)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_spec}{An object of class \code{mstATA_model}. The full model
must be infeasible.}

\item{con_blocks}{An integer vector giving the indices of constraint
blocks (rows of \code{model_spec$specification}) to be jointly tested.
These blocks are added to the core constraints as a group.}

\item{solver}{A character string indicating which solver to use.
One of \code{"gurobi"}, \code{"lpsolve"}, \code{"HiGHS"},
\code{"Symphony"}, or \code{"GLPK"}.}

\item{time_limit}{The maximum amount of computation time allocated to the solver.
Default is 99999 seconds.}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
\describe{
\item{blocks_tested}{Character vector of requirement names corresponding
to \code{con_blocks}.}
\item{status}{Solver status returned for the reduced model (e.g.,
\code{"INFEASIBLE"}, \code{"OPTIMAL"}, \code{"FEASIBLE"}).}
}
}
\description{
Diagnoses infeasibility in an \code{mstATA_model} by testing whether a
user-specified combination of constraint blocks, together with the
core set of constraints, results in an infeasible model.

The full model must be infeasible. A reduced model is constructed that
always includes the core constraints (objective-related constraints and
essential MST structure constraints) and additionally includes the
constraint blocks specified in \code{con_blocks}. The solver status of
this reduced model is then evaluated.
}
\details{
The reduced model always includes a fixed core set of constraints:
\itemize{
\item Objective-related constraints.
\item Essential MST structure constraints (e.g., module-/pathway-level
item count constraints, routing decision points constraints, item reusage within
a panel).
}

The constraint blocks specified in \code{con_blocks} are added to this
core \emph{simultaneously} and tested as a group. This function does not
perform a one-at-a-time or incremental check; instead, it evaluates the
feasibility of the combined block set.

This function is primarily intended for second-stage infeasibility
diagnostics, such as verifying suspected conflicting constraint
combinations or validating results from block-wise or additive
diagnostic procedures.
