\description{
Constructs an \code{"mstATA_model"} object that encapsulates a mixed-integer
linear optimization model used in automated test assembly (ATA).

The model consists of linear constraints defined over binary and continuous
decision variables, optional model specifications for bookkeeping, and
optimization metadata (objective sense and variable bounds). This function
performs extensive input validation to ensure internal consistency between
constraint matrices, decision variables, and bounds.
}
\details{
The constraint system is represented as:

\deqn{
  A_B x_B + A_C x_C \; (\text{operator}) \; b
}

where \eqn{x_B} are binary decision variables and \eqn{x_C} are continuous
decision variables.

The objective function is defined as:

\deqn{
  \min/\max \; C_B^\top x_B + C_C^\top x_C
}

Continuous decision variables are subject to lower and upper bounds specified
by \code{lb_bound} and \code{ub_bound}. Binary variables are implicitly bounded
in \eqn{\{0, 1\}}.
