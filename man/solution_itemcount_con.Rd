\description{
Constructs solution-level constraints on the \emph{total number of distinct
items} selected across all panels in a multistage test (MST) assembly.

This requirement enforces a user-specified:
\itemize{
\item minimum number of unique items,
\item maximum number of unique items, or
\item exact (fixed) number of unique items
}
that may appear anywhere across all assembled panels.

These constraints operate at the \strong{solution level}, using decision variables
that indicate whether an item appears in \emph{any module of any panel}.

The number of constraints generated is 1. If both a range needs to be specified,
call this function twice.

\details{
\strong{1. Specification}

This constraint enforces:

\strong{
A minimum, exact, or maximum number of \emph{unique items} must be selected
across all panels in one solution.
}

Key characteristics:

\itemize{
\item The attribute type is \emph{categorical}: each item is assigned a unique ID.
\item The attribute is defined at the \emph{item level} in the item pool.
\item The constraint is applied at the \strong{Solution-level}, i.e., across all panels.
}
}
\section{Mathematical Formulation}{


Suppose the item pool contains (S - 1) stimulus-based item sets, indexed by
\eqn{s = 1, \ldots, S - 1}. Each stimulus has a designated pivot item,
indexed by \eqn{i_s^{*}}. In addition, the pool contains a set of discrete
(non–stimulus-based) items, which are represented by a dummy stimulus
\eqn{s = S} to allow a unified indexing scheme. Items belonging to stimulus
\eqn{s} are indexed as \eqn{i_s = 1, 2, \ldots, I_s}.

For each item \eqn{i_s},

\deqn{
  s_{i_s} =
  \begin{cases}
    1, & \text{if item } i_s \text{ is used in any module in any panel}, \\
    0, & \text{otherwise}.
  \end{cases}
}

The solution-level variables track whether an item appears anywhere in the assembled
multi-panel solution.

The total number of unique item selected at the solution
level is controlled through:

\deqn{
  \sum_{s=1}^{S} \sum_{i_s=1}^{I_s} s_{i_s}
  \;\substack{\le \\ \ge \\ =}\;
  n^{item} .
}
Here:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{s_{i_s}} is the binary decision variable indicating whether
item \eqn{i_s} is used at least once across all panels.

\item \eqn{\substack{\leq \\ \geq \\ =}} denotes that the specification may take the form of an
upper bound, lower bound, or exact value.

\item \eqn{n^{item}} is the user-specified minimum, exact, or maximum number of unique items.
}
