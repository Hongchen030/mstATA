\title{Validate Enemy Set Specification}
\usage{
validate_enemy_set(enemy_set)
}
\arguments{
\item{enemy_set}{A list with components \code{ExclusionPair} and \code{EnemySet}.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{TRUE} if validation succeeds; otherwise an error
is thrown.
}
\description{
Validates an enemy-set specification consisting of pairwise exclusions
(\code{ExclusionPair}) and an accompanying grouped representation
(\code{EnemySet}).
}
\details{
\code{ExclusionPair} is treated as the authoritative definition of enemy
relationships (pairwise exclusions). \code{EnemySet} is treated as an
explanatory or grouped representation of those exclusions.

Validation enforces consistency and referential integrity between the two
components, but does not require \code{EnemySet} to enumerate all pairwise
exclusions implied by grouping (e.g., transitive closure or clique expansion).

The following conditions are enforced:
\itemize{
\item \code{ExclusionPair} must be a character matrix with exactly two columns.
\item No self-pairs are allowed in \code{ExclusionPair}.
\item No duplicated enemy pairs are allowed (order-insensitive).
\item \code{EnemySet} must be a list of character vectors with length \eqn{\ge 2}.
\item Every pair in \code{ExclusionPair} must appear together in at least one
element of \code{EnemySet}.
\item Every item appearing in \code{EnemySet} must appear in at least one row
of \code{ExclusionPair}.
}
