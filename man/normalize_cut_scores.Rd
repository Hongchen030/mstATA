\title{Normalize routing cuts to the score scale}
\usage{
normalize_cut_scores(cut_scale = "score", cuts, icc_list = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{cut_scale}{Character string indicating the scale of \code{cuts}.
Must be one of \code{"score"} or \code{"theta"}. Default is \code{"score"}.}

\item{cuts}{A numeric vector of internal cut scores. For
\code{"score"}, these are number-correct cut points; for
\code{"theta"}, these are ability cut points. Values must be strictly
increasing.}

\item{icc_list}{A named list of item category probability matrices
evaluated on an ability grid. Required when
\code{cut_scale = "theta"}.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of cut scores on the score scale.
}
\description{
Converts routing cuts to the number-correct (score) scale so that
they can be used consistently in score-based routing logic for
multistage testing (MST).
}
\details{
Routing decisions in recursion-based evaluation method are based on observed scores (number correct).
When cut scores are specified on the ability (\eqn{\theta}) scale, they
must be converted to equivalent score-scale cut points using the test
characteristic curve (TCC) implied by the items already administered.

If \code{cut_scale = "score"}, the input cut scores are assumed to already
be on the score scale and are returned unchanged after validation.

If \code{cut_scale = "theta"}, each cut value \eqn{\theta_c} is converted
to a score-scale cut point via

\deqn{
c = E(S \mid \theta = \theta_c),
}

where \eqn{S} denotes the cumulative score and the expectation is computed
by interpolating the test characteristic curve derived from
\code{icc_list}. The accuracy of this conversion depends on the density
and range of the ability grid used to construct \code{icc_list}.

The returned cut scores are on the score scale and may be non-integer.
Observed scores are integers and are compared against these (possibly
fractional) cut points during routing.

\examples{
## score-scale cuts (returned unchanged)
normalize_cut_scores("score", cuts = c(5, 10))

## theta-scale cuts converted to score scale
icc_list<-compute_icc(mini_itempool,list("3PL"=c("discrimination","difficulty","guessing")),
            theta = seq(-5,5,0.1),model_col = "model",D = 1)
normalize_cut_scores(
  "theta",
  cuts = c(-0.5, 0.8),
  icc_list = icc_list
)
