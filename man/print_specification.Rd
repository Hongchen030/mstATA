\title{Print a formatted specification table for a panel specification}
\usage{
print_specification(spec)
}
\description{
This function is a \strong{low-level formatting utility} intended for inspecting
specification tables extracted from \code{"mstATA_panel_spec"} objects.

It reorders columns, optionally adds a human-readable row-range column
(e.g., \code{"rows 15–28"}), and prints the result for interactive inspection.
The function is strictly \emph{non-mutating}: it does not modify global options,
solver models, or the underlying panel specification object.
}
\details{
The printed specification table provides a semantic summary of how
high-level requirements (constraints, objectives, and automatically injected
decision-variable linking rules) map onto contiguous row ranges in the
compiled constraint matrix.

This view is particularly useful for:

\itemize{
\item diagnosing infeasibility by identifying conflicting constraint blocks;
\item understanding which rows correspond to auto-injected constraints
(e.g., decision-variable linking);
\item prioritizing or relaxing groups of constraints programmatically; and
\item debugging solver output with respect to original test specifications.
