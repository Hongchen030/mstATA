\usage{
concat_enemy_sets(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more enemy relationships returned by \code{create_enemy_sets()}.
Each input must be a list with the following components:
\describe{
\item{ExclusionPair}{A two-column character matrix of pairwise enemy relationships.}
\item{EnemySet}{A list of character vectors representing explicitly defined enemy sets.}
}}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\describe{
\item{ExclusionPair}{A two-column character matrix of unioned enemy pairs.}
\item{EnemySet}{A list of enemy sets formed by concatenating all inputs.}
}
}
\description{
Concatenates enemy sets produced by \code{create_enemy_sets()}.
Enemy sets from each source are \strong{appended without modification}, while
pairwise enemy relationships are \strong{unioned} across all inputs.
No transitive closure or set expansion is performed.
}
\details{
Suppose source A defines five enemy sets and source B defines two enemy sets.
The resulting object will contain \strong{seven enemy sets}, formed by simple
concatenation of the input \code{EnemySet} components.

The \code{ExclusionPair} component of the result is the union of all unique,
unordered pairwise enemy relationships across inputs.

Importantly, no transitive inference is applied. If item A is an enemy of B
and item B is an enemy of C (possibly from different sources), this function
does \strong{not} infer that A is an enemy of C.

This function is intended for situations where enemy relationships are
defined from multiple independent sources (e.g., similarity, cluing,
or security rules) and must be preserved exactly as specified.

\examples{
## Example: combining multiple sources of enemy relationships
## Enemy relationships based on similarity
similarity <- create_enemy_sets(
  id_col    = mini_itempool$item_id,
  enemy_col = mini_itempool$enemy_similarity
)

## Enemy relationships based on cluing
cluing <- create_enemy_sets(
  id_col    = mini_itempool$item_id,
  enemy_col = mini_itempool$enemy_cluing
)

## Combine all enemy relationships into a single enemy set
enemy_all <- concat_enemy_sets(
  similarity,
  cluing
)
enemy_all
}
