\title{Inverse test characteristic curve from ICCs}
\usage{
inv_tcc_from_icc(icc_list, target_score, range_tcc = c(-5, 5), tol = 1e-04)
}
\arguments{
\item{icc_list}{A named list of item category probability
matrices across a grid of ability values. Each element corresponds to
one ability level and must be named \code{"theta=<value>"}. Rows
represent items and columns represent response categories
(\code{cat0}, \code{cat1}, \dots). Can be created by \code{compute_icc()}.}

\item{target_score}{A numeric value giving the target expected total
score for which the inverse TCC is to be computed.}

\item{range_tcc}{A numeric vector of length two specifying the lower
and upper bounds of the ability interval used for inversion.
Defaults to \code{c(-5, 5)}.}

\item{tol}{A numeric tolerance passed to the root-finding algorithm.
Smaller values yield more precise solutions at increased
computational cost. Default is 1e-4.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value giving the ability
such that the expected module score at this ability equals the
target score, up to numerical tolerance.
}
\description{
Numerically inverts a module test characteristic curve (TCC) to obtain the ability
corresponding to a given observed total score.

\section{Mathematical Formulation}{


Consider a module consisting of \eqn{I} items. Let the score for item
\eqn{i} be a discrete random variable \eqn{Y_i} taking values
\eqn{\{0, 1, \dots, m\}}, where \eqn{m} is the maximum item score
for item i. Conditional on ability \eqn{\theta}, item
responses are assumed to be locally independent, with category
probabilities

\deqn{
\Pr(Y_i = k \mid \theta) = p_{ik}(\theta),
\quad k = 0,\dots,m.
}

The expected score for item \eqn{i} at ability level \eqn{\theta} is

\deqn{
E(Y_i \mid \theta) = \sum_{k=0}^{m} k \, p_{ik}(\theta),
}

and the expected total module score (the test characteristic curve) is

\deqn{
T(\theta) = E(S \mid \theta)
  = \sum_{i=1}^{I} E(Y_i \mid \theta),
}

where \eqn{S = \sum_{i=1}^{I} Y_i} denotes the total module score.

Given a target score \eqn{s^\ast}, the inverse TCC problem is to find
\eqn{\hat{\theta}} such that

\deqn{
T(\hat{\theta}) = s^\ast.
}

Because \eqn{T(\theta)} generally has no closed-form inverse, this
function evaluates \eqn{T(\theta)} on a grid of ability values using
ICCs and constructs a continuous approximation via linear
interpolation. A root-finding algorithm is then used to solve

\deqn{
T(\theta) - s^\ast = 0
}

on a specified ability interval.

\strong{3PL and Non-Invertible Scores}

When items follow the three-parameter logistic (3PL) model with
guessing parameters \eqn{g_i > 0}, the TCC has a nonzero lower bound:
\deqn{
  \lim_{\theta \to -\infty} \text{TCC}(\theta)
  = \sum_{i=1}^I g_i = G.
}

Therefore, any NC score \eqn{S < G} cannot be obtained from the
TCC for any finite \eqn{\theta}, and the inverse TCC is undefined
in the strict sense.

To ensure a monotone score-to-theta mapping, the minimum
invertible NC score is defined as
\deqn{
  X = \lceil G \rceil,
}
the smallest integer strictly greater than the guessing floor.

Let \eqn{\theta_{\min}} denote the lower bound of the restricted
ability range (given by \code{range_tcc[1]}), and let \eqn{\theta_X}
denote the inverse-TCC solution corresponding to score \eqn{X}.

For any score \eqn{Y} such that \eqn{0 \le Y < X}, the ability
estimate is obtained by linear interpolation between
\eqn{(0, \theta_{\min})} and \eqn{(X, \theta_X)}:

\deqn{
  \theta^*(Y)
  = \theta_{\min}
    + \frac{Y}{X}
      \left(\theta_X - \theta_{\min}\right).
}

This construction:
\itemize{
\item Preserves monotonicity of the score-to-theta function;
\item Respects the lower bound imposed by 3PL guessing;
\item Ensures continuity at \eqn{Y = X};
\item Avoids artificial extrapolation of the TCC.
}

Scores above the maximum attainable TCC value are mapped to
the upper bound \code{range_tcc[2]}.

In multistage testing (MST), inverse TCC values are used to equate number
correct scores across pathways and to evaluate routing accuracy, bias, and
conditional standard errors of measurement.
