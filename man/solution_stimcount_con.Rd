\description{
This function constructs a \strong{solution-level constraint} that controls the
number of \emph{distinct stimuli} appearing in the final multi-panel MST assembly.

The constraint may impose a:
\itemize{
\item minimum number of unique stimuli,
\item maximum number of unique stimuli, or
\item fixed (exact) number of unique stimuli.
}

that may appear anywhere across all assembled panels.

The number of constraints generated is 1. If both a range needs to be specified,
call this function twice.
}
\details{
\strong{1. Specification}

This constraint enforces:

\strong{A minimum, exact, or maximum number of unique stimuli must be selected across all panels in the assembled MST solution.}

Key characteristics:

\itemize{
\item The attribute type is \emph{categorical}: each stimulus is assigned a unique ID.
\item The attribute is defined at \emph{stimulus level} in the item pool.
\item The constraint is enforced at the \strong{Solution-level}, i.e., across all panels.
}

\section{Mathematical Formulation}{


Suppose the item pool contains (S - 1) stimulus-based item sets, indexed by
\eqn{s = 1, \ldots, S - 1}. Each stimulus has a designated pivot item,
indexed by \eqn{i_s^{*}}. In addition, the pool contains a set of discrete
(non–stimulus-based) items, which are represented by a dummy stimulus
\eqn{s = S} to allow a unified indexing scheme. Items belonging to stimulus
\eqn{s} are indexed as \eqn{i_s = 1, 2, \ldots, I_s}.

For each item \eqn{i_s},

\deqn{
  s_{i_s} =
  \begin{cases}
    1, & \text{if item } i_s \text{ is used in any module in any panel}, \\
    0, & \text{otherwise}.
  \end{cases}
}

The solution-level variables track whether an item appears anywhere in the assembled
multi-panel solution.

The total number of unique stimuli selected at the solution
level is controlled through:

\deqn{
  \sum_{s=1}^{S-1} s_{i_s^{*}}
  \;\substack{\le \\ \ge \\ =}\;
  n^{stim} .
}

Here:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{s_{i_s^{*}}} indicates whether the pivot item for stimulus
s is selected in any panel, thereby indicating whether the stimulus s
is selected in any panel.

\item \eqn{\substack{\leq \\ \geq \\ =}} denotes that the specification may take the form of an
upper bound, lower bound, or exact value.
