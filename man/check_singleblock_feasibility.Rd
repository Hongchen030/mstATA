\arguments{
\item{model_spec}{An object of class \code{mstATA_model}. The model must be
infeasible.}

\item{solver}{A character string indicating which solver to use.
One of \code{"gurobi"}, \code{"lpsolve"}, \code{"HiGHS"},
\code{"Symphony"}, or \code{"GLPK"}.}

\item{time_limit}{The maximum amount of computation time allocated to the solver.
Default is 99999 seconds.}
}
\value{
A data frame with one row per constraint block tested.
}
\description{
Diagnoses infeasibility in an \code{mstATA_model} by solving a sequence of
reduced models. The full model must be infeasible. A core set of constraints
(objective-related constraints and essential MST structure
constraints) is checked for feasibility first. If feasible, the core set of
constraints is always included. Each remaining constraint block is then tested
individually by solving a reduced model that contains the core constraints plus
exactly one additional constraint block (i.e., non-core blocks are not accumulated).
}
\details{
The core model always includes:
\itemize{
\item Objective-related constraints.
\item Essential MST structure constraints (e.g., module-/pathway-level
item count constraints, routing decision points constraints, item reusage within
a panel).
}

The MST structure constraints ensure that the fundamental structural requirements of the MST design are
satisfied.

Specifically, MST structure constraints include:

\strong{(1) Item count constraints}

(a) Number of items in each module is provided in \code{mst_design()}

\itemize{
\item One constraint is created for each module.
\item Each module must contain \emph{exactly} the specified number of items.
}

(b) Number of items in each pathway is provided in \code{mst_design()}.

\itemize{
\item Each pathway must contain \emph{exactly} the specified number of items.
\item Optional stage-level structure constraints may additionally enforce:
\itemize{
\item Minimum number of items per stage.
\item Maximum number of items per stage.
}
\item If \code{stage_length_bound = NULL}, the following default stage-level
structure is enforced:
\itemize{
\item Each stage must contain at least one item.
\item Modules within the same stage must have equal length.
}
}

\strong{(2) Routing decision points constraints}

These constraints are generated when \code{rdp} is provided in
\code{mst_design()}.

\itemize{
\item The test information at the routing decision point between adjacent
modules in the next stage is similar within a specified tolerance.
}

\strong{(3) Panel-level item usage constraints}

These constraints are generated using \code{panel_itemreuse_con()} limiting
how many times an item may be selected across the modules and pathways contained within a single MST panel.

After checking the feasibility of the core set of constraints, all
other (non-structural) constraint blocks are tested individually by adding
them to the core model one at a time. This function does not attempt to diagnose
infeasibility arising from interactions among multiple non-core constraint
blocks.
